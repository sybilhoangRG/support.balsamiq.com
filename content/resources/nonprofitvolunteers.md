Our in-house UX experts are available to collaborate with you on the design of your product for a one-hour online wireframing session. <em>This session will be recorded and published for educational purposes so others can learn wireframing.</em>

To take advantage of this resource, apply to our [Free Program](https://balsamiq.com/free) and make sure to check the box "I'd like help wireframing my website or product." If you're already part of our Free Program as a nonprofit, you can apply by emailing us at [community@balsamiq.com](mailto:community@balsamiq.com).

We're a small company with only several experts and a limited number of slots available every week. <em>Please only apply for a design session if you can not afford to hire an expert.</em>
