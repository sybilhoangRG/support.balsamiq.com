Yes!

There is an awesome [eBook of Balsamiq Interviews](https://balsamiq.com/learn/inspiration/interviews/) by Bob Walsh that includes interviews with nine different Balsamiq users. Each interviewee contributes an interesting perspective on using Balsamiq and its advantages and limitations.

It's a great complement to our [Case Studies on our blog](https://blog.balsamiq.com/category/case-studies/). Also, **it's free!** [Get it here](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/interviews/).

There is also a book about Balsamiq Mockups 2 (our old version) by Scott Faranello. It's called "Balsamiq Wireframes Quickstart Guide". You can [get it on AmazonÂ here](http://www.amazon.com/Balsamiq-Wireframes-Quickstart-Guide-Faranello/dp/1849693528).

We think this book nicely complements [our support website](/), with easy-to-follow and quick-to-digest steps that will take you from zero to mastering our little tool in a very short time.
