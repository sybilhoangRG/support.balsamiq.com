At Balsamiq we are big fans of open source software. We use a lot of it to power our business and our infrastructure, and we try to give back to the open source community whenever we can:

We open source parts of our code and tools, usually with MIT licensing. Visit [https://github.com/balsamiq](https://github.com/balsamiq) to find out more.
