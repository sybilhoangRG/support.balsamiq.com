Not at the moment. A behind the firewall version is not in the plans, but maybe a private-cloud one could be a possibility.

[Let us know if youâ€™d like to chat about it](mailto:peldi@balsamiq.com). In the meantime, you might want to look into [Balsamiq Wireframes for Confluence Server](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/256/balsamiq-wireframes-confluence-server) instead.
