**Welcome!** If you're here to learn the basics of user interface design, you're in the right place. This short course will teach you everything you need to know to feel confident talking about, reviewing, and even venturing into the design of software user interfaces. It does _not_ cover the other areas of user experience design, a broad discipline that includes user research, usability testing, data analysis, copywriting and other considerations not central to the design of the user interface.

The **[Introduction](intro/)** will give you an overview of the topics and lessons covered in this course.
