## Learn *just enough* user interface design from the experts at Balsamiq.

This short course will teach you everything you need to know to feel confident talking about, reviewing, and venturing into the design of software user interfaces. It is meant for Product Managers, Entrepreneurs, and other non-designers who work in software and want to feel more comfortable in the world of UI design.

<!--It does _not_ cover the other areas of user experience design, a broad discipline that includes user research, usability testing, data analysis, copywriting and other considerations not central to the design of the user interface.-->
