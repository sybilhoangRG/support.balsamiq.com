## Step 3: Submit Your Proposals to the Core Group

Once you have a few sketches, it's time to go back to the stakeholders for a quick check-in, to see if the direction you've gone in makes sense to everyone.

Make sure you call these sketches "early, quick drafts" and you tell everyone that "you're not married to any of these ideas". This way they won't hold back honest feedback for fear of hurting your feelings.

DO NOT email your sketches or otherwise "send them over the wall". They're too rough to be understood. Schedule quick 1-1 chats with each stakeholder, and walk them through each sketch.

Your goal is to gather as much feedback as possible on where each role would like the design to go. This step is important because your sketches - even in their roughness - are very powerful: they allow everyone to visualize the solution in their minds. This will in turn trigger thoughts and concerns that they couldn't have thought about during requirement gathering.

Note that each person might care about different aspects of the solution. Executives or sales people might care more about branding and strategic importance rather than usability. Developers care mostly about implementability, graphic designers generally care about aesthetics. Learning what each stakeholder cares about is an important part of the process! The more you do it, the better your wireframes will be next time: just like in those old cartoons, you will feel like you have each little person on your shoulders giving you feedback as you design. 

Make sure to take good notes as you do this round of feedback - put them on your wiki page!

If some of the feedback is great, "obvious" and non-controversial, go ahead and incorporate it in your design right away, you don't have to wait until you've spoken to everyone.

## Step 4: Incorporate Feedback Into Wireframes

Now it's time to turn your sketches into proper wireframes.

Look at your different designs, study your feedback list, and try to put it all together into a single solution.

If you had been using paper sketches before, this is a good time to transform those into Balsamiq wireframes, as they're generally easier to understand and share.

Once again, use everything you've learned in the previous chapters to create wonderfully usable, lovable designs.

Note that you should still very much keep things at **low-fidelity** here, it's still too early to risk getting people get distracted by pretty colors and icons. This is especially true when building a new feature, web page, or product.

We recommend only designing the key screens at this point (probably less than a dozen). There will be time to think about confirmation dialogs and error conditions later.

You might want to use the [Symbols](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/symbols/) feature for headers and footers, and you might want to [link screens together](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/linking/) to help you walk through them - though it's generally not required as long as you sort your wireframes in a way that flows naturally.

We believe that it's important at this point to **allow others to participate in the wireframing process**. Just because their job title says "developer" or "business person" it doesn't mean that their user interface ideas should be discounted. Balsamiq, for instance, was built specifically to allow non-designers to have a seat at the table. Don't be too  protective of your designs. Instead, invite others who are interested in sharing their user interface ideas to your project! In Balsamiq Cloud for instance, you can do this [very easily](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/sharing/). They can work alongside you, creating alternate versions for you to review, and you can easily [comment on their designs](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/sharing/#reviewing-and-commenting) so you can iterate together.

Make sure you **work closely with development** at this point! They will likely have constraints you don't know about, and their green-light - even a reluctant one - is essential to move forward. By the time you're done, you should know that what you designed is buildable by X people in roughly Y amount of time.
