## Step 7: Work Closely with Developers!

Alright so you have the green light, now it's time to work closely with development to make sure that your designs get built faithfully.

You can help in several ways.

First off, **add a lot more details and annotations** to your set of wireframes.

Be ready and quick to answer any questions the developers will have.

Make time in your schedule to review early implementations, on staging or via screen-sharing sessions from the developers' machines.

Think of all the possible edge cases and write them down. This will help the developers write unit tests, it will help manual testers to verify each case, and it will allow your support and documentation teams to make sure everything is well documented, with the right screenshots.

Schedule weekly (or even daily!) check-ins with the developers, to see how work is progressing.

**Don't be afraid to go back to wireframing!** If you notice parts of your design not feeling quite right once they've been implemented in real code, go back to your wireframes and tweak the design to make it work! Life is full of compromises after all.

## Step 8: Help With Testing, Deployment and Marketing!

As the feature gets close to being ready, you'll be in a great position to help answer questions about the feature from different stakeholders.

Marketing will want to know how to highlight the feature, the documentation team will have you review their work on it, the execs will want a real demo before launch.

You'll be very popular, and like a proud parent, you'll see your new feature get released to the world. Yay!
