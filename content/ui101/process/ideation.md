## Step 2: Sketch Out Ideas

This is the funnest part, the most creative of the whole process.

Some software teams like to do this part together in a meeting room with a whiteboard, or by using real-time-collaboration in a wireframing tool like Balsamiq Cloud. Other teams like to do an exercise where multiple people come up with solutions on their own, and then get together to review them and pick the best elements of each.

The vast majority of the time though, this phase is done by one person, alone.

So, make sure you get a good night sleep, block out at least 2 hours in your calendar, make sure you're properly caffeinated, quit Slack, turn off email notifications, put your phone to charge in the other room, close your door, put your headphones on, play some relaxing music (Balsamiq Wireframes has it built-in in the View menu), and get yourself ready to get in the [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)).

If you're artistically inclined and are not afraid of a white page, you might want to start by sketching ideas on paper. Just keep it high level, [boxes and arrows](http://boxesandarrows.com/), so to speak.

If you can't draw a straight line to save your life, or find a white page intimidating because it allows you too much freedom (which might make your design too hard to implement), a tool like Balsamiq is perfect for you. You can just pick standard elements from the UI Library and assemble them. Make sure you use the [Sketch skin](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/skins/) for this step! Switching to the wireframe skin or - God forbid - using a tool that allows you to design at high fidelity, **is a terrible mistake** at this point! Unless you have superhuman self-control, you'll find yourself thinking WAY too far ahead, fiddling with details like colors, fonts, and pixel-perfect alignments. That's a huge waste of time right now.

If you're just adding a piece of functionality to an existing user interface, you might find it faster to take a screenshot of the existing UI and tweaking it by using the crop image tool. Here's a [tutorial specifically about this topic](https://support.balsamiq.com/tutorials/croptool/). We're also working on [a magical feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SxuZsEu3No) which will help you go from screenshot back to low-fidelity with one click.

Now it's the time to use all the tips and techniques you learned about in the previous chapters.

Don't be afraid to start over! Balsamiq offers unlimited wireframes, unlimited Undo, [Alternates](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/alternates/) and Project History, so you can easily create different versions and go back in time if you need to.

If you want to see what this process looks like in real life and in real time, check out our ["Wireframing with Balsamiq"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2W8n1FBUc&list=PLVlyYfbClWxSKenahQlGgP0MLtycbDeuz) playlist.

Once you're at a good stopping point, **go for a walk, take a hot shower, or a quick nap!** \- the warm and cozy environment away from the computer will help your brain digest what you just did and suggest changes and improvements.

Your goal right now is not to come up with "the definite solution", but rather to come up with some user interfaces to submit to the team as proposals, to see how they react to them.

Be careful not to fall in **the "version 3" trap**! Because of how our brains work, we usually tend to put way too many details in our wireframes.

So, once the initial wireframes are done, try to scale them back once (version 2), and then do it again, to get to what should be released in version 1.

If you want to show the whole vision to the team, add some annotations that say "v.2" or "this can come later". You could use yellow Pointy Buttons controls for those, or Vertical Curly Braces.
