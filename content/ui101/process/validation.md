## Step 5: Pitch to the Larger Group

Once you've worked on your design for a couple of days, and maybe circulated it electronically with the core team one more time for final review, it's time to present it to everyone.

This will be more of a sales meeting than a brainstorming meeting. You will be pitching your design to all the stakeholders, confident that it will satisfy the requirements. You will still accept feedback, but don't expect too much of it.

Aside all of the stakeholders from step 1, make sure you invite the person that's _high up_ enough to be able to **give your design a green light, so that development can start** \- usually an executive, or _the client_. That's your main goal with this meeting.

One trick that some of our customers use at this point is to switch to the Wireframe skin. It's still low-fidelity, but it's a bit more polished, just enough not to elicit the same amount of feedback as the Sketch one. 

Walk people through each of the screens you designed, one by one. Try to keep the presentation engaging: avoid getting bogged down in too many details. If objections occur, make a note of them and promise deal with them 1 on 1 after the meeting (if possible).

If you did your job well involving the core team over and over ahead of the meeting, this presentation should be a breeze. See [Tips for Presenting Your Wireframes](https://blog.balsamiq.com/wireframe-presentation-tips/) for more about this important milestone.

## Step 6 (optional, discouraged): Make a High-Fidelity Prototype

Back in the days of waterfall, when 18-month release cycles were the norm, building prototypes was a great way to reduce the risk that your solution - even if well thought-out and approved by your team - would miss the mark with customers.

Today's world is much more _agile_. Developers can turn your wireframes into something for you to play with in days, not weeks or month.

High fidelity prototypes take a while to build (you have to design every single screen in detail, link every single element to its destination, provide fake data, etc) and are done with expensive tools with a high learning curve. If you have a UX designer on staff - lucky you! - this would be a job that only they can do.

Iterating on prototypes is also painful: changing high-fidelity designs in Sketch or Photoshop takes time, and re-wiring all the pieces of the prototype is a painful process.

Last but not least, once you're done with a prototype, you throw it away.

For these reasons and more, we usually advocate skipping the high fidelity prototyping phase entirely, and going straight to code. Even if your wireframes missed the mark enough for you to have to change 15% of the UI code, you'll still be able to keep the remaining 75%.

That said, creating high fidelity prototypes might make sense sometimes - say, you're building a car, or a satellite...something not easy to iterate on after it's released.

Some, usually large, companies use high fidelity prototypes to get buy in from executives. The idea is that in the enterprise world, _the suits_ don't want to see low fidelity, sketchy-looking stuff. They want to see the real thing, in all of its branded glory. 

Another use of high fidelity prototypes is for self-service user-testing. Some people think that end-users will not give you meaningful feedback unless they see the whole thing, as if it was real. It might be, but we've involved our users at the wireframing stage several times, with great results.

You should try and see what's best for you and your company.

If you do this step, expect to add at least a few weeks to the schedule.
