## Step 9: Monitor How It's Received!

It's amazing how many people don't do this, or don't even consider doing this.

In a way it's understandable, it was such a struggle to get from idea to production, most designers are probably exhausted at this point. 

But if you don't know if your feature is well received by the end users, how will you get better at designing?

There are many ways to see if a feature was successful: you can track usage via metrics, you can look for mentions of it on Twitter, or - our favorite way - you can interview your users about it!

## Closing Thoughts

That's it. We hope this brief high level outline helped you in preparing for what the life of a UI designer - even a non-professional one - is like when taking something from idea to production.

We hope it gave you a sense of who the stakeholders are and what each phase entails.

As we said before, every organization is different, the process above is a weird average of what we heard during dozens of user research interviews with Balsamiq customers.
