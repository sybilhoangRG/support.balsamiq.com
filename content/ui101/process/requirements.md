## Step 1: Gather Requirements

So it happened: an idea for a new product or feature landed on your lap and you have to design a solution for it.

Ideas come from all over the place: if you work for a product company, they often come via the support or sales teams because of customer requests. Other times they are deemed strategically important by _the powers that be_ (PMs, executives, marketing...). Some other times, the development and design team came up with them! If you're a solo founder, you're doing all of this idea gathering and prioritizing yourself! 

If you work for a consulting company, these dynamics often happen within your clients' organizations. They just call you when they're ready to execute on the idea.

Regardless of how it happened, it's time to start executing.

The first step is to understand what people are asking you to do. This phase is normally called **gathering requirements**.

Gathering requirements is its own discipline, some people make it their whole careers. Here's a very high-level overview.

First of all, make sure you **shift the conversation from solutions** and ideas for solutions **back** **to "what problem are we trying to solve"**.

Humans have a very strong tendency to automatically jump to solutions any time they encounter a problem, so it's likely that by the time the request comes to you, it's already framed with a solution in mind.

For instance, you might be asked to "add search to the site or app". Seems clear enough, right? Well, because the request is framed as a solution, you might do all the work to design it, but the solution might miss the point entirely. Maybe the problem your customers wanted to solve would have been solved much better by improving the onboarding flow, or by adding phone support as a support channel! You just don't know!

So step one is to create a wiki page or google doc - or whatever tool you use to communicate internally on projects - and put the "**What Problem(s) Are We Trying to Solve**" title right at the top.

Now, make sure you assemble the correct group of stakeholders. You should include those who asked for this feature, leadership from development, marketing, and ideally someone who will be impacted by this change. If it's too hard to find an external customer (it shouldn't be too hard), find an internal customer to act as their proxy. Someone from tech support, for instance.

Next, go around and ask all the stakeholders _what problem are we trying to solve with this change_, and take notes on the page. In some cases, you might have to use the [5 Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) technique to get to the root of the problem. Look for patterns in the responses and categorize the answers so that you have a clean bullet list of requirements on your page.

Once you get to the bottom of what the problems are and have digested it fully (sleep on it!), you might want to circulate the page with the stakeholders again, to make sure everyone agrees that yes, those are the problems we want to solve.

At this point, you should also have a better understanding on how important or urgent this change is for everyone.

Once that's done (ideally in a day or two), you can start shifting towards thinking about possible solutions.

First up, try to avoid the "_if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail_" problem. In other words, don't jump to what's easy for you to do. Try to think more holistically, and **really try to put yourself in the end-user's shoes**.

**Don't limit your thinking to a software solution**, think about the [Whole Product concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_product) instead. Maybe the best solution is better documentation, or training, or a process change, or starting a podcast! 

Spend a day or two testing these possible super-high-level ideas with the stakeholders again.

If you all agree that a software solution is worth pursuing, it's time to move on to the next step.

Note that this doesn't necessarily mean that you're committing to implementing whatever solution you're about to design. It might well be that what you design cannot be implemented in time and on budget, or cannot be supported by your organization...at this point you're just committing to exploring a possible software solution to the problem.
