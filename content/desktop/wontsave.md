We've recently discovered a conflict with Mockups' save window and corporate IT permission software like [Digital Guardian](https://digitalguardian.com/). If your Mac has one of these software suites installed, you are probably having trouble saving your files.

Fear not, your work is still being saved by [Mockups' internal backup system](https://support.balsamiq.com/desktop/backup/), but digging your files out of the backup folder is less than ideal.

## Can We Fix This?

We aren't sure if your IT team can adjust the permissions due to the oddness of the error, but the workaround is easy!

The save dialog still works, but the Finder shortcuts on the left side of the screen don't (or, more specifically, the permissions they use to navigate to the save folder conflict with the permission software). However, if you use the dropdown menu to navigate to the folder you want to save in  - instead of the shortcuts on the left -  the save should complete successfully.
