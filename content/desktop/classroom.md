with it, they will see that the application's fully-functioning trial period will be extended for the duration of your class.

## Sharing and Grading Project Files

Your school probably already has a means for students to share files with each other, and with you for grading.

Some schools use Dropbox, some others use Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive, or others. We generally work well with these tools.

Balsamiq 3 for Desktop project files are no different: each BMPR file contains everything that's necessary to work on and
review a Balsamiq project.

You can also have your students [Export their Projects to PDF](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/exporting/#exporting-to-pdf) and share them with you, if you prefer.

## Training Your Students in Mockups

Our tools are famous for being easy to use, but you might want to direct your students to our [support portal](/)
for documentation and tutorials. A good place to start from theÂ [Creating Your First Mockup](/tutorials/firstwireframe/) tutorial.

You can also point your students to these two free courses on Mockups:

* [Wireframing with Balsamiq Mockups](https://www.udemy.com/wireframing-with-balsamiq-mockups/) on Udemy
* [Rapid Wireframing: Finding the Right Product Design](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/design/Rapid-Wireframing-Finding-the-Right-Product-Design/1947996659) on SkillShare
