Native web apps like [Balsamiq Cloud](https://balsamiq.cloud) can be tricky to troubleshoot, especially when it comes to the number of browser and browser plugins available to users today. One thing that can help us (and you) figure out what's going on is your browser's developer (or Javascript) console. Here is how to find it on most modern browsers.

## Apple Safari

Before you can access the developer console in Safari, you first need to enable the **Developer Menu**. To do that, go into Safari's preferences (**Safari Menu > Preferences**) and select the **Advanced Tab**.

Once that menu is enabled, you will find the developer console by clicking on **Develop > Show Javascript Console**. You can also use the shortcut **Option + ⌘ + C**.

The console will either open up within your existing Safari window, or in a new window. It will automatically select the Console tab.
