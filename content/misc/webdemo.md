With the launch of our new web version, [Balsamiq Cloud](https://balsamiq.cloud/), we have decided to close down our old web demo. It was based on Adobe Flash, and it was time for us to move on to a **native** editor. :)

## What Can I Use to Try out Your Product Instead?

Balsamiq Cloud comes with a 30 day free trial (just like [all our products](https://support.balsamiq.com/sales/evaluate/)). It is fully functional so you'll get the chance to explore the whole package. See our [Cloud documentation](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/) for more details.

## How Do I Import My Existing File(S) in Balsamiq Cloud?

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** These steps assume that you already have an existing Balsamiq Cloud account and [Space](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/spaces/). If you don’t already have one, make sure to check out the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/intro/#quick-start-guide) to get started on your project.{{% /alert %}}

Now that the web demo site is no longer available, any projects and wireframes created there are no longer available. If you previously downloaded a project you can easily get it into Cloud. See the [Managing Projects](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/projects/) documentation to learn more.
