For a long time, Adobe's Flex Framework (Flash and Air) gave us a ton of flexibility. We could write the code once, and then build it on any browser and OS we wanted. However, given the restrictions that Flex imposes on us, and the rise of native web technologies, it's time for us to move on.

**A number of versions of our app are now Flash-free: [Balsamiq Cloud](https://balsamiq.cloud/); and [Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive, Confluence, and Jira](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/plugins/)**

Balsamiq Cloud is completely **native** (no Flash). We've fully rebuilt our app with the goal of making it feel smooth on all platforms, while reusing as much of the codebase as possible.

## What about the Rest of Your Products?

We are hard at work at bringing the native code to our Desktop version and the plugins that don't yet have it. We are going to work on mobile versions too!

Stay tuned to our [blog](http://blogs.balsamiq.com/product/). As soon as we have more news to share, we will announce it there!

## Is Flash Player Still Supported in Browsers?

Currently (November 2017), all major browsers still support it but they no longer run Flash Player content by default.

When you try to start the editor (e.g., in myBalsamiq, our legacy web version), you may receive a warning from the browser. If not, you might see a blank page with a link in the top-left corner. In this case, please click the link to manually start Flash Player in your browser.

You will find some useful steps to check if Flash Player is correctly enabled on [this page](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html) (Adobe's website).
