Modern web browsers save a lot of data locally because it helps save time and battery life. Unfortunately, this data may not always be up-to-date, and that can cause problems in web apps like [Balsamiq Cloud](https://balsamiq.cloud).

This page should help you clear your cache in most modern web browsers. If we don't have your browser listed, please [reach out](mailto:support@balsamiq.com), and we will do our best to add it!

## Apple Safari

To clear the cache in Apple Safari, you first need to enable the **Developer Menu**. To do that, go into Safari's preferences (**Safari Menu > Preferences**) and select the **Advanced Tab**.

At the bottom of that preference pane is a checkbox to **"Show Develop menu in menu bar"**. Check it.

A new option called **Develop** will appear in your menu. Click on it and select **Empty Caches**.
