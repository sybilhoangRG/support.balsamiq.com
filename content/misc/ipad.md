## Is There an iPad Version in the Works?

Stay tuned to our release announcements on our [release announcements page](https://blog.balsamiq.com/category/release-notes/).

## Can I Use the Online Version (Balsamiq Cloud) on My iPad?

You can, but the editor part doesn't respond to all finger inputs properly at the moment. We plan on fixing this over the next few weeks.

Our long term plan is to create a native iPad application to allow you to fully control your Balsamiq Cloud account and projects.
