Yes! Projects can be easily packed with many elements, and sometimes it's good to take a moment to do some house keeping. Cleaning up your project will make it easier to navigate, smaller in size, and thus **much** faster!

Let's look at few different ways to optimize a project.

## Select the Unused Images/Assets

Using [Assets](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/images/) can be really useful when creating your wireframes but since we spend most of the time in the Wireframes view, Assets can easily become cluttered with unnecessary elements.

With that in mind, we created an option that allows you to select all images that are not used in your wireframes. The option is available in the Edit menu, as shown below:

Selecting it will open the Assets view where all the unused images will be selected for you. You can then move all the items to the trash from the context menu.

## Clean Up the Symbols

[Symbols](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/symbols) are another great feature that let you create reusable common elements that you can use across different wireframes. Let's look at the best way to keep them "clean".

When an individual Symbol is selected, the lower portion of the right panel shows which wireframes (if any) the Symbol is used in. This is a good indication for deleting Symbols that aren’t being used.

You can use the context menu to delete Symbols and Symbol Libraries from your project.

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** Deleting Symbol Libraries will move them to the trash, where you can [delete them permanently](#empty-the-trash) or restore them. Deleting an individual Symbol from a Symbol Library, however, deletes it permanently.{{% /alert %}}

**Tip:** You can hold down Shift or Control/CMD to select multiple Symbols and delete multiple Symbols at once.

## Empty the Trash

Moving items to the [Trash](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/overview/#trash) does not remove them from the project. Using the "Empty Trash" option is the only way to delete those items **permanently**.

## Extra Step: Split Your Project Into Smaller Ones

On a side note, we usually recommend keeping a project under 100 wireframes to avoid performance issues. Sometimes, splitting a project into smaller ones is a nice and easy way to help with slowness issues too.

We hope that these tips will be useful to improve your project's organization and help with any performance issues you may hit.
