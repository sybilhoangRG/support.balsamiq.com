Believe it or not, spellcheck is one of the harder features to implement into an app.

## Why Don't Your Apps Have Spellcheck?

Because our apps were built on top of Adobe technology (and not the frameworks native to your OS or browser) we didn't get access to the native dictionary that every modern OS and browser ships with. If we wanted to include spellcheck, we would have had to bundle our own dictionary, which would dramatically increase the size of the app.

## Will Your Apps Ever Get Spellcheck?

It's definitely something we want to add, (we have been known to misspell a word or two) and it is something that will be a lot easier now that our apps are running on native frameworks. While there is a lot of work ahead of us, spellcheck is near the top of our list of things to explore once we move completely native.
