Your Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive subscription allows you to designate another user as an **Additional Administrator**. You can find the steps to do so [here](/sales/gdrivesubscription/#additional-administrator).

### Troubleshooting the Error Message

If you're getting this error, this means that the person that you're trying to designate as an administrator already has administrative rights to a _different_ subscription. Because of the way our system is designed, an administrator can only be a full admin of one subscription at a time.

It's possible that this person either has their own subscription that they have paid for, or someone else has designated them as the administrator of one. The way around this would be to contact them directly, and do one of the following:

* Have that person [cancel their subscription](/sales/gdrivesubscription/#stopping-your-subscription)
  * After that is done, have that person remove themselves from their canceled subscription, as shown below. If they believe they are owed a refund, they can reach us directly at [sales@balsamiq.com](mailto:sales@balsamiq.com).

* If that person is the administrator of a subscription that currently has two admins, they can remove themselves **without canceling the subscription** first. By removing themselves, they become available to be added as an admin of another subscription.

Once either of the points above has been accomplished, you will be able to proceed to designate that user as an additional administrator for your subscription.
