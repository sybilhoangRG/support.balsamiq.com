We do not support hibernating and reactivating myBalsamiq sites. We keep sites with inactive subscriptions for a minimum of [1 month](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/tos/#how-can-i-access-or-correct-my-information). After 1 month, the site data may be deleted.

If you won't be using myBalsamiq anymore, you can [download all your projects](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/project/#uploading-and-downloading-projects) to your machine. Make sure you save them somewhere safe in case you need to come back in the future. These projects can be [uploaded](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/importing/#importing-from-mybalsamiq) to Balsamiq Cloud if desired.

On the other hand, if you're already using [Balsamiq Cloud](https://balsamiq.cloud/), you have the option to allow your Space to auto-hibernate. This still requires that you download your projects locally, but you won't be billed if you follow the steps detailed here: [Balsamiq Cloud Auto-Hibernation](/sales/cloudsubscriptions/#auto-hibernation).
