No, Balsamiq products are proprietary software applications.

We make use of some open-source software, as stated in our [EULA](https://balsamiq.com/legal/terms/eula/) appendix.

Note: Balsamiq does offer [free or discounted licenses](https://balsamiq.com/free) for official Open Source Projects and community organizations, and [we open source some of our internal tools and libraries](/resources/opensourcecontributions/) — it’s our way of giving something back. :)
