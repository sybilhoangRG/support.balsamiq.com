## What Is the Difference between An "Upgrade" and An "Update"?

An **upgrade** is a purchase to change from an existing license to a license for a greater number of users (or to a greater number of projects in Balsamiq Cloud).

An **update** is when you download and install the newest version of Balsamiq. For more information on updating to new versions see [Software maintenance (support and updates)](/sales/maintenance/)

## How Can I Order an Upgrade?

You can upgrade to a larger license or plan at any time.

### Mockups 3 for Desktop

You will need your current License Key when ordering. You'll have one single license for the total number of users. Registered users won't have to do anything, and the new users will register with the new License Information. To purchase start [here](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#du).

### Balsamiq Cloud

Space Owners or Billing-Only Administrators can upgrade or downgrade plans at any time in their [Space Settings](/sales/cloudsubscriptions/#changing-your-plan). When upgrading or downgrading, subscriptions will automatically receive credit for any time remaining on the old plan level.

### Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive

Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive is priced per user, which we refer to as _Editors_. They have the capability of creating and editing wireframes. There can be up to two administrators on a particular subscription, and either admin can [downgrade or upgrade](/sales/gdrivesubscription/#changing-your-plan) the plan as they see fit. When doing so, subscriptions will automatically receive credit for any time remaining on the old plan level. 

### Wireframes for Confluence Server or Jira Server

For licenses purchased directly from Balsamiq you will need your current License Key when ordering. After your purchase, replace your old License Information with the upgrade License Information.

Direct links to order: [Wireframes for Confluence Server](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#cu) and [Wireframes for Jira Server](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#ju).

Licenses purchased through [Atlassian Marketplace](/sales/marketplace/) can be upgraded through [my.atlassian.com](https://my.atlassian.com).

Customers who originally purchased from Balsamiq and are using Wireframes for Confluence Server or Wireframes for Jira Server on their own servers have an option to [migrate to Atlassian Marketplace](/sales/atlassianmigrating/) before upgrading.
