This page describes how you can purchase a Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive subscription, cancel your plan, and make changes to your billing information.

Subscriptions for Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive are tied to your Google ID (email address). You can choose to [purchase a team subscription](#choosing-and-managing-a-team-plan) to include others, and pay for them.

The Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive documentation is [here](https://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/wireframes/).

## Signing up for a Subscription

Before signing up for a subscription, you must first [install](https://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/wireframes/installing/) Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive.

As subscriptions are tied to specific Google IDs, be sure you are logged in to the Google ID (email) with which you plan to use Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive.

At the end of your fully-functional [30-day trial](/sales/evaluate/) period, you will still be able to view and comment on your existing wireframes, but you will not be able to edit or create new wireframes unless you sign up for a paid plan.

Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive is sold as a monthly or yearly subscription paid exclusively via automatic credit card payments.

To sign up for a plan, open Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive by creating a [new project](http://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/wireframes/intro/#getting-started) (or opening an existing one), and then select **"Sign Up for a Paid Plan"** from the Help menu.

You will then be taken to the billing page, where you can select your preferred plan and proceed by selecting "Sign Up". Remember that you are free to [cancel your subscription](#stopping-your-subscription) at any time.

## Choosing and Managing a Team Plan

When choosing a plan as described above, you will notice that you can select multiple editors. An _Editor_ is a user that has the ability of creating and editing wireframes. This gives you the flexibility of adding colleagues to your subscription.

The first step is merely selecting the **number** of editors you need.

![](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/sales/bwgd/full_plans_dropdown.png)

You can select to pay on a monthly or yearly basis, and you can always [upgrade or downgrade](#changing-your-plan) your plan as you see fit.

After you have selected and paid for your team plan, your billing page will contain a section titled **Balsamiq Wireframes Editors**. You will see a text box where you can enter your colleagues' email addresses.

![](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/sales/bwgd/editor_list.png)

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** Make sure that you select **"Save"** after adding or removing people.{{% /alert %}}

After you add their email addresses, your colleagues will be able to create and edit wireframes. If they haven't installed the plugin already, you can send them the link to do so. You can add and remove editors at any time.

### Additional Administrator

A new option introduced with the team plans is the capability of designating an **Additional Administrator**. This means you can designate another user to manage the subscription with you. This can be particularly useful for bigger teams, or to simply have a backup admin that can step in when you're not around. You will find this option directly on your billing page, which you can access by opening a project, and then selecting Help > Manage Your Subscription.

![](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/sales/bwgd/add_admin.png)

Both administrators will have equal rights, and both can change and cancel a plan. Like so, the Additional Administrator will be able to add and remove users from the list of editors, and they will also have the ability of **removing you from the subscription**. A copy of the monthly or yearly invoice will also be emailed to both administrators.

How Can I Proceed?"](/sales/gdriveadmin/#troubleshooting-the-error-message){{% /alert %}}

### Removing Yourself as Administrator

If you no longer need to manage a particular subscription, you can remove yourself at any time. Bear in mind that this option will only appear if there is another admin on the account, or if your subscription is no longer active.

The "Remove me as Administrator" option will show up underneath the credit card and payment info, as shown below:

![](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/sales/bwgd/remove_me_admin.png)

Clicking the button will prompt a dialog for you to confirm the action. Once you have confirmed the removal, the action will immediately take effect, without an option to revert it. If you have removed yourself by mistake, you can choose to [subscribe](#signing-up-for-a-subscription) to a new plan, or contact the remaining administrator so they can [designate you as an admin](#additional-administrator) once again.

## Updating Your Credit Card or Invoice Information

If you're the administrator of a subscription, first, select **"Manage Your Subscription"** from the Help menu. This will bring you to your billing page. Here is an example of what a billing page looks like:

![](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/sales/bwgd/new_billing_page.png)

Select "Update Credit Card" to update the credit card and billing address for future renewals. If you only wish to update the billing address on future invoices, select "Show Address", and then "Update Address." 

To edit the address shown on a previous invoice, select the specific invoice in the Billing History.  You'll be able to edit and download a PDF of the transaction.

The [invoice notification email](#finding-past-invoices) is always delivered to the email address associated with the subscriber's Google ID. If there are two administrators, both of them will receive a copy of the invoice.

* * *

## Changing Your Plan

As an administrator, you can upgrade and downgrade plans, and change plan frequency (monthly to yearly or vice versa) at any time.

First go to your billing page, as described [above](#updating-your-credit-card-or-invoice-information). Then select "Change Plan", verify that the correct plan is chosen, and then tick the option for "Monthly" or "Yearly". Select "Change Plan" and then "Confirm Plan".

You will automatically receive credit for any time remaining on your old plan. If additional money is required, your credit card will be charged for the remainder due. If there is any unused credit, it will be applied toward future renewals.

You will not be required to re-enter a credit card number, and your new subscription period will start immediately.

* * *

## Finding Past Invoices

Invoice notifications are sent automatically following an automatic credit card payment. A link to the invoice, as well as to your billing page is included in this email. If there are two administrators, then **both** of them will receive the email and invoice.

Outside the administrators, we do not offer delivery of invoices to any other email addresses.  However, if you need to share invoices with your financial department, you can easily forward the email notifications. Keep in mind that you must be logged in with the correct Google ID to view your billing page, the link to your invoice can be viewed and downloaded by your finance team without logging in.

* * *

## Stopping Your Subscription

As an administrator, you can cancel Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive at any time.

First, select **"Manage Your Subscription"** from the Help menu within the editor. This will bring you to your billing page.

Select "Cancel Subscription" and then confirm the cancelation. By selecting "Cancel Subscription", you will stop the auto-renew of your plan. Your credit card will no longer be charged, and service will be unavailable at the end of the current billing cycle.

After your subscription ends, you will be able to view existing wireframes in your Google Drive account. However, you will no longer be able to edit or create new wireframes.

* * *

## Restarting Your Subscription

If you wish to restart your subscription, simply select "Restart Subscription" from your billing page.

You can access the billing page for your inactive subscription by trying to [create a new project](http://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/wireframes/intro/#getting-started), or by opening an existing project and selecting "Sign up for a paid plan" in the notification bar at the bottom of the viewer.

You'll need to enter your credit card to complete the re-activation.

* * *

## Changing Your Google ID

Your subscription is tied to a single Google ID (email address). Your subscription renewal notifications will be sent to this email, and you will need to be logged in with the correct Google ID in order to access Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive.

If you wish to change your subscription to use Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive with a different Google ID (email), you'll need to [stop your current subscription](#stopping-your-subscription) and [re-sign up](#signing-up-for-a-subscription) when logged in with the Google ID you prefer to use.

If you purchased the subscription for the wrong Google ID or user, not to worry! We have a very generous [refund](/sales/refunds/) policy to get you back on track.

* * *

## Pin Payments Subscribers

If you signed up for a subscription before April 29, 2015, and you haven't made changes to your billing info since then, it's possible you're still on our old payment processor's system. As a result, you have not been migrated to Stripe, our current processor.

To migrate, all you need to do is update your credit card information on file. From there on, your credit card will be managed securely by [Stripe](/sales/safe/)

A new subscription period will start when you do so. Any unused time on your current subscription period, as well as any subscription credit, will be transferred to our new system.

After you have migrated, you will have better invoices, and you will also gain access to our [newest team plans](#choosing-and-managing-a-team-plan).

If you come across any issues, please don't hesitate to [shoot us an email](mailto:sales@balsamiq.com?subject=Issues%20Migrating%20From%20Pin%20Payments).
