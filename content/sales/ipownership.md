Yes.

Balsamiq does not claim intellectual property rights over wireframes created with any of our products. If you'd like to read the full terms for each product, you can find direct links below:

* [EULA](https://balsamiq.com/legal/terms/eula/#15) **(Mockups 3 for Desktop, Wireframes for Confluence Server and Wireframes for Jira Server)**
* [Terms of Service](https://balsamiq.com/legal/terms/tos/#ip-rights) **(our other products)**

That said, if you use images created with Balsamiq in a **book**, **eBook**, **website**, **software,** or **advertisement**, we'd appreciate a little mention, something small like this:

_<small>Created with [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).</small>_

Here's the HTML for it:

<textarea class="full" rows="2"><em><small> Created with <a href="https://balsamiq.com">Balsamiq</a>.</small></em></textarea>

Peldi's wife Mariah and our nice guy designer Mike have put a lot of love into creating those wireframe pieces, they deserve a little credit don't you think?

If instead you want to use any of the **icons** found in Balsamiq, the credit should go to <a href="http://fontawesome.io/">FontAwesome</a>. Here's a link to their very generous <a href="http://fontawesome.io/license/">license</a>.

Thanks! :)
