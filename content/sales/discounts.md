## Discounts When Purchasing Multiple Mockups 3 for Desktop Licenses

We offer discounted pricing for Mockups 3 for Desktop via Volume Licenses. Discounts start at 5 users and increase with the number of users. Pricing can be found [here](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#dv).

Our Desktop [upgrade prices](https://balsamiq.com/buy/desktopupgrades/) are also based on our volume discounts. You receive the same volume discount whether you bought the licenses all at once, or decided to [upgrade](/sales/upgrades/) to more users later.

Volume licenses also make license management easier: you'll have one single Mockups 3 for Desktop license for your total number of users.
