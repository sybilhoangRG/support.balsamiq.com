[Balsamiq Cloud](https://balsamiq.cloud/) offers a handy role called **[Billing-Only Administrator](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/spaces/#making-someone-a-billing-only-administrator).** This role will allow you to subscribe to a Balsamiq Cloud plan on behalf of your end user. To do this:

1. If they haven't already, ask your end user to [create a Balsamiq Cloud](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/intro/#quick-start-guide) account along with [the Space](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/spaces/#creating-a-new-space) where they will create their wireframes and projects.

2. The end user that creates the Space will be the Space Owner. They can then designate you, the reseller or purchaser, as the [Billing-Only Administrator](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/spaces/#making-someone-a-billing-only-administrator). Note that this role does not grant you access to their projects or wireframes.

3. Check your email to find the link inviting you to join your end user's Space. Once you have completed the steps to create your account and have accepted the invitation, you will be able to **view** their billing page. That is the section where you will select the plan they wish to subscribe to, and you will also enter your payment details.

And that's it. You, as the Billing-Only Admin, will be able to [change the plan](/sales/cloudsubscriptions/#changing-your-plan) as often as needed. Your end user will not be able to make changes to billing unless they know the credit card details you entered. They will, however, be able to **[cancel](/sales/cloudsubscriptions/#stopping-your-subscription)** the subscription if they wish to.

Invoices will be generated and emailed to you as well as the Space Owner(s) every month or year (depending on the frequency).
