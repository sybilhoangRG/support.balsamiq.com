We follow [Atlassian's Support End of Life Policy](http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/Support/Atlassian+Support+End+of+Life+Policy), meaning that as soon as Atlassian stops supporting a certain version of Confluence or Jira, we'll update the plugin to stop supporting that version as well.

You can check compatibility and download older versions directly in Atlasssian Marketplace for [Wireframes for Confluence Server](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/256/balsamiq-wireframes-confluence-server/versions) and [Wireframes for Jira Server](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/5161/balsamiq-wireframes-for-jira-server/versions).
