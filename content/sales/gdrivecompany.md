Yes! With the latest version of Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive, you have the ability to purchase a subscription for multiple people (we call these _Editors_).

After subscribing to the selected plan, you will be able to add the Google email addresses of the people you wish to pay for. They will be able to create and edit wireframes, thanks to your subscription.
