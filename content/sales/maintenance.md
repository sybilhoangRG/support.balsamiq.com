## What Is Maintenance?

Software maintenance covers access to any [relevant support](/sales/support/) and [software updates](/sales/update/).

We release often—[about every 1-2 months](https://blog.balsamiq.com/category/release-notes/)—to get bug fixes and new features in your hands as fast as possible. Then we follow up each release with [fanatical customer support](https://balsamiq.com/company/#who).

For additional details check our [End User Licensing Agreement and Terms of Service](https://balsamiq.com/legal/terms/).

## When Does My Maintenance Start and End?

**Mockups 3 for Desktop** has no maintenance or renewal costs for the license. [Minor-version (3.x) updates](/sales/updatedesktop/) are free to all Desktop license holders, and we publish [new releases](https://balsamiq.com/download/) frequently. Support is provided via Balsamiq forums: [https://forums.balsamiq.com/](https://forums.balsamiq.com/)

**Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive**, **myBalsamiq**, **Balsamiq Wireframes for Confluence Cloud** and **Balsamiq Wireframes for Jira Cloud** are subscription-based tools. Maintenance is included for as long as your subscription is active.

Software maintenance for our plugins **Wireframes for Confluence Server** and **Wireframes for Jira Server** is sold for periods of 12 months at a time. The start date of the maintenance period depends on the type of purchase you are making:

*   **New license purchase:** Your 12 months of free software maintenance begins on the date of purchase.
*   **Upgrade purchase:** Your 12 months of plugin maintenance begins on the date of the [upgrade](/sales/upgrades/) purchase and replaces any maintenance on the original license.
*   **Maintenance renewal purchase**: Your 12 month software maintenance will begin on the expiration date of the previous maintenance period, regardless of when the maintenance renewal was purchased.

## What Happens after the First 12 Months?

All new licenses for Balsamiq Wireframes for Confluence Server and Balsamiq Wireframes for Jira Server include 12 months of free maintenance.

Renewing maintenance is entirely optional for those who have Confluence Server or Jira Server: you can continue to use an older version of our software if you don't wish to renew. We keep [archived versions](https://balsamiq.com/download/archives/) of our software should you need an old version.

Renewing your software maintenance is done at your discretion and can be renewed in advance of your maintenance expiration to ensure [uninterrupted access](#when-does-my-maintenance-start-and-end) to the support and software updates.

## Why Should I Renew?

Renewing maintenance on your Wireframes for Confluence Server or Wireframes for Jira Server license will ensure our product continues to integrate with any changes made to your plugin platform and you'll get the benefit of improvements made to the software.

We constantly improve and update our software. Check out our [release announcements](https://blog.balsamiq.com/category/release-notes/) (also available as an [RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/BalsamiqReleaseAnnouncements)) to see what we have recently improved.

## How Much Does It Cost?

The current pricing information for Wireframes for Confluence Server and Wireframes for Jira Server, including maintenance renewal pricing, is always available on our website:

*   [Wireframes for Confluence Server](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#cm)
*   [Wireframes for Jira Server](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#jm)

Other Balsamiq products do not have separate [maintenance](/sales/maintenance/#when-does-my-maintenance-start-and-end) costs.

## How Can I Purchase?

The answer depends on where the original Wireframes for Confluence Server or Wireframes for Jira Server license was purchased.

Maintenance renewals for licenses purchased directly from Balsamiq can be purchase by credit card directly on our website, using your current License Key:

*   [Wireframes for Confluence Server](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#cm)
*   [Wireframes for Jira Server](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#jm)

We have [additional payment options](/sales/paymentmethods/#licenses) for orders over $300, and customers using Wireframes for Confluence Server or Wireframes for Jira Server on their own servers have an option to [migrate to Atlassian Marketplace](/sales/atlassianmigrating/) before renewing.

Licenses purchased through [Atlassian Marketplace](/sales/marketplace/) can be renewed through [my.atlassian.com](http://my.atlassian.com).

Other Balsamiq products do not have separate [maintenance](#when-does-my-maintenance-start-and-end) costs.

## Can I Purchase More than 12 Months?

We only sell maintenance for Wireframes for Confluence Server and Wireframes for Jira Server 12 months at a time.

## Can I Change the License Dates?

No, we do not synchronize or co-term maintenance renewal dates to coincide with other license renewals.

However, if you are using Wireframes for Confluence Server or Wireframes for Jira Server on your server, you might consider [migrating your license to Atlassian Marketplace](/sales/atlassianmigrating/), which supports co-terming maintenance renewal dates.

## Can I Upgrade/Downgrade When I Renew?

Wireframes for Confluence Server and Wireframes for Jira Server licenses purchased directly from Balsamiq do not need to match your Confluence Server or Jira Server server levels.

If you'd like to upgrade to more editors when it's time to renew your maintenance, you can purchase an [upgrade license](/sales/upgrades/). You can upgrade at anytime after your original purchase, as well as after your maintenance period expires.

If you'd like to downgrade to a smaller number of editors, you'll need to purchase a [new plugin license](/sales/marketplace/#who-should-i-buy-the-plugin-from) at the new level you desire.
