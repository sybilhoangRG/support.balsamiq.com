Are you using Google Chrome and getting the following error message when opening a project in Balsamiq for Google Drive?

```
ReferenceError: gapi is not defined
```

* * *

## What Is Causing the Error?

This error is usually generated by a conflict with another Chrome **extension** (plugin).

The best way to verify this is to launch the app from an ["Incognito" Chrome window](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) or from another browser. If Balsamiq for Google Drive works fine there, it is probably a conflict with one of the Chrome extensions installed.

You can find which one causes the conflict by disabling all your extensions and enabling them again one by one.

## Is There a Way to Keep Using Balsamiq for Google Drive and My Extension?

This might not work for all extensions but in the case of **Disconnect**, whitelisting "h<span>ttps://balsamiq-wireframes.appspot.com" in the extension's options should do the trick and allow Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive to open.
