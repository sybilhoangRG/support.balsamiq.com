You may need to display wireframes on different Confluence pages. While there is no direct way to do this (for now), we've created this page to describe a workaround that will help you with this.

## Displaying a Wireframe on Multiple Confluence Pages

### 1. Grab the Wireframe Image Link From the Attachments

Once you have identified the wireframe you want to use on different pages, open the Confluence page attachments.

![](//media.balsamiq.com/img/support/prodfaqs/attachments.png)

From there, right-click on the image file generated from your wireframe (PNG) and copy the link address.

### 2. Use the Link in Your Other Confluence Page

Once you have copied the link, please open the other Confluence page and **insert an image**. From the insert dialog, select **images from the web** and copy the link there.

Once that is done, please remove **api=v2** from the image link and insert the image. You now have your wireframe displayed on the Confluence page.
